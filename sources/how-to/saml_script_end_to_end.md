# Using SAML script without SAML Proxy ( Asimba ) in Gluu Server

This documentation is going to show us how to configure Gluu Server ( v 2.4.4 ) SAML Script without SAML Proxy server ( aka. Asimba ). 
For the preparation of this documentation we have used three servers: 
  - https://test.gluu.org ( Gluu Server whose SAML script we are going to use )
  - https://nest.gluu.org ( Remote Gluu Server which is going to act as AuthN server for end users )
  - https://sp.gluu.org ( Test service provider whose protected resources we are going to access through SSO )

## Configuration in test.gluu.org server

## Configuration in nest.gluu.org server

## Configuration in sp.gluu.org
